# GitHub Projects and Pages
Did you know that you can use GitHub for things like project management and creating beautiful web pages for your repositories? You can use these to highlight and organize your work.

## Project Management

### Kanban Project Sample
[6 column Kanban board](https://github.com/snugsfbay/Test/projects/1): this example project shows a basic six column Kanban board you can use to classify issues during the various parts of a work cycle. The columns represent parts of the work cycle for writing code and writing content, everything from basic ideas in the TODO/thesis column to Deployed/Published and finally the Done column to track all the way from idea to completion.

### Basic Project Sample
Projects let you organize the work effort. They are broken down into columns that help you classify your ideas and your todo list so that they can be easily understood.  You might classify ideas according to progress being made, as in the Kanban board example.  Or you might classify ideas based on teams or their functional relationship such as this [2016 Hackathon Project](https://github.com/orgs/StrideforceHub/projects/1).

### Notes, Cards and Issues
Project ideas can be created as Notes, Cards or Issues.

* **Notes:** Added to any column of your project, these can be dragged from one column to another to reorganize your ideas and work efforts. These can be converted to Issues using the 

* **Issues:** Added to any GitHub repository typically as a feature request, bug report, question, or even a request for help. These are related to specific code and content stored in that repository. 

  - *Open:* Issues that need a resolution.
  
  - *Closed:* Issues that have been addressed and appear to be resolved one way or another.
  
* **Cards:** Using the "Add Cards" option for the Project, you can search for existing Issues to add to your project as Cards that can be moved from column to column. For example, an Issue might be tracked across the Kanban-style project as it approaches completion or it might be placed in a column that indicates which team or area of functionality it relates to in the basic sample. 

### Milestones
Issues can also be associated with Milestones. Use Milestones to track the number of open vs. closed issues and associate them with specific deadlines. You might have Milestones around production phases or around scheduled activities like presentations and training.


## Easy-Read Web Pages
GitHub pages offer a way to serve up the repository and project in a more friendly way. Sure, the Readme.md looks good on the project home, but it looks even better on its own web page, with a theme selected on the repository settings.

### Preview
You can't really preview pages before publishing them, at least not in a WYSIWYG format, which can lead to lots of commits on your repository as you revise and tweak content and layout.

### Privacy
Obviously, the repositories, pages, projects and issues discussed here are public. Private repositories are available with paid licenses from GitHub and will have private projects and issues (and Wikis). GitHub Pages are always public, regardless of the repository. For private pages, you can add authorization as long as pages are served up via Heroku or similar, [as described on this blog post](http://www.alexandrejoseph.com/blog/2015-03-11-restricted-github-pages.html).
